# MCU

## Architecture
- what a car can do like go straight, go backward, go left, go right
- It basically specifies what a system should do 

## Micro-architecture
- How to implement all of these features in a real car
- Depending on the design and manufacturing company, car design might vary
- The basic functionality of the car should be the same

## To master CPU
- Programmers' model: details out the mode of operation and internal register that CPU has
  - How can a programmer think about CPU to do the computation
- Memory model: It specifies how the CPU interacts with the memory
  - like cpu stores some result in registers and sent it out in memory 
- Exception Model : 
- Debug Model : Like external HW is connected to debugging circuit of cpu
  - like **gdb** debugger has some power and limitation in terms of debugging the cpu

## Exception vs Interrupts
- **Exception** happens internal to the CPU (like accessing wrong memory address)
- **Interrupt** happens external to the CPU
