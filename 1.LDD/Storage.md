### 1.What does SMU_CDB_INVALID_INFO mean?
It means:

 The UFSHC attempted to access a memory address (CDB buffer) which is:

- Outside of the permitted SMU region OR

- Not mapped correctly in the **`DDR/IPMMU/IOMMU`** OR

- Violating some access control policy

This results in:

- A `SMU violation interrupt` or exception

- The SMU_CDB_INVALID_INFO log message (from SMU or UFS driver/BSP log)




âœ… How to Debug This
Check your CDB buffer allocation:

- Use `dma_alloc_coherent()` or `dma_alloc_attrs()` with **DMA_TO_DEVICE** for CDB

- Avoid kmalloc() or vmalloc() unless youâ€™re mapping manually

Inspect SMU configuration:

- Is the UFSHC master ID allowed access to the DDR region of CDB?

- Check platform SMU config in QNX BSP or device tree (on Linux)

ðŸ”„ Relation to UFSHC
UFSHC performs DMA for commands and data.

Both SMU and S2MPU ensure that the UFSHC only accesses memory it's allowed to, based on:

- Which VM is using it

- Which memory region was allocated for the buffer

If **CDB/PRDT** is not mapped properly, you will hit:

- `SMU_CDB_INVALID_INFO` (SMU violation)

- or **Stage-2 MMU fault** (S2MPU violation)

ðŸ§ª Example (Simplified)
If QNX is VM0 and Android is VM2:

- S2MPU will be configured such that:

    - UFSHC can access only **the CDB/PRDT memory allocated in VM0 when QNX owns UFS**

    - If Android tries to reuse the same memory region (outside its allowed S2MPU window), it gets blocked

- SMU, on the other hand, might block all access to `0x9000_0000â€“0x9FFF_FFFF` unless whitelisted for UFSHC


### 2. Write Booster feature from UFS 3.0 onwards

### 3. VH can send UFS Query for Device Management/ Device Control
