## Procfs 
This folder is a mount point for the procfs (**Process Filesystem**) which is a **filesystem in memory.**

Many processes store information about themselves on this virtual filesystem. 

- `/proc/partitions` — currently connected block devices and their partitions
- `/proc/interrupts` — registered interrupt request numbers
- `/proc/devices` — registered character and block major numbers

#### In the output of the command 
 `cat /proc/devices`, the loop under the block devices refers to loopback devices in Linux. 
These devices are a special kind of virtual block device that map regular files (or other block devices) to appear as block devices themselves.
- **Mounting ISO Files:** You can mount an ISO file as a filesystem using a loop device:

```c++
sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt
```


The proc files need to be writable in this case.For example, to enable IP forwarding of iptable, one can use the command below,

`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`


The proc entry can also be used to pass data to the kernel by writing into the kernel, so there can be two kinds of proc entries.

- An entry that only reads data from the kernel space.
- An entry that reads as well as writes data into and from kernel space.

## Example of procfs created by me
```bash
linux@embetronicx-VirtualBox:ls /proc/

filesystems      iomem      kallsyms      modules    partitions   etx

linux@embetronicx-VirtualBox:  cat /proc/etx/etx_proc

try_proc_array

linux@embetronicx-VirtualBox: echo "device driver proc" > /proc/etx/etx_proc

linux@embetronicx-VirtualBox:  cat /proc/etx/etx_proc

device driver proc
```
### Creating procfs directory

You can create the directory under /proc/* using the below API.

`struct proc_dir_entry *proc_mkdir(const char *name, struct proc_dir_entry *parent)`

where,

- name: The name of the directory that will be created under /proc.
- parent: In case the folder needs to be created in a subfolder under /proc a pointer to the same is passed else it can be left as NULL.


### Creating Procfs Entry

Note: The above proc_create is valid in the Linux Kernel v3.10 to v5.5. From v5.6, there is a change in this API. The fourth argument const struct file_operations *proc_fops is changed to const struct proc_ops *proc_ops..

```c++
struct proc_dir_entry *proc_create ( const char *name, umode_t mode, struct proc_dir_entry *parent, const struct file_operations *proc_fops )
```

The function is defined in proc_fs.h.

Where,

- name>: The name of the proc entry
- mode>: The access mode for proc entry
- parent>: The name of the parent directory under /proc. If NULL is passed as a parent, the /proc directory will be set as a parent.
- proc_fops>: The structure in which the file operations for the proc entry will be created.
- As an example 
```c++
proc_create("etx_proc",0666,NULL,&proc_fops);
```


### Procfs File System
This is like a device driver file system. We need to register our proc entry filesystem. 
```c++
static struct proc_ops proc_fops = {
        .proc_open = open_proc,
        .proc_read = read_proc,
        .proc_write = write_proc,
        .proc_release = release_proc
};
```

### Open and Release Function
```c++
static int open_proc(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "proc file opend.....\t");
    return 0;
}

static int release_proc(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "proc file released.....\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Write Function
The write function will receive data from the user space using the function copy_from_user into an array “etx_array”.
```c++
static ssize_t write_proc(struct file *filp, const char *buff, size_t len, loff_t * off)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "proc file write.....\t");
    copy_from_user(etx_array,buff,len);
    return len;
}
```



### Read Function

Once data is written to the proc entry we can read from the proc entry using a read function, i.e transfer data to the user space using the function copy_to_user function.
```c++
static ssize_t read_proc(struct file *filp, char __user *buffer, size_t length,loff_t * offset)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "proc file read.....\n");
    if(len)
        len=0;
    else{
        len=1;
        return 0;
    }
    copy_to_user(buffer,etx_array,20);

    return length;;
}
```

### Remove Proc Entry
Proc entry should be removed in the Driver exit function using the below function.
```c++
void remove_proc_entry(const char *name, struct proc_dir_entry *parent);

remove_proc_entry("etx_proc",NULL);
```
