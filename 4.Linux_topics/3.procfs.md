## Procfs 
This folder is a mount point for the procfs (**Process Filesystem**) which is a **filesystem in memory.**

Many processes store information about themselves on this virtual filesystem. 

- `/proc/partitions` — currently connected block devices and their partitions
- `/proc/interrupts` — registered interrupt request numbers
- `/proc/devices` — registered character and block major numbers

In the output of the command cat `/proc/devices`, the loop under the block devices refers to loopback devices in Linux. 
These devices are a special kind of virtual block device that map regular files (or other block devices) to appear as block devices themselves.
- **Mounting ISO Files:** You can mount an ISO file as a filesystem using a loop device:

```bash
sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt
```


The proc files need to be writable in this case.For example, to enable IP forwarding of iptable, one can use the command below,

`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
