We can follow any of the way

### >> Why kernel also need "system.map" and "initrd" along with vmlinux ?

- There are some external modules present in `ext4 fs` **(present in Hard drive)** which kernel is not aware of that. But some of those modules are necessary for booting up the procedure. Some of those modules are present in `initrd` ( **init ram disk**)
- `initrd` contains essential drivers and tools needed to **mount the real root file system.** The `initrd` allows the kernel to boot and load critical modules (e.g., **for accessing disks or filesystems**) before the main file system is mounted.
- The `System.map` file is a symbol table for the Linux kernel. It contains a mapping between symbol names (e.g., functions and variables) and their corresponding memory addresses in the kernel.
- `vmLinux` won't know how to load few system call. How to access those calls in `initrd`. It will be mapped by `system.map`. 

- In modern monolithic kernel, we can not put everything in kernel images. There must be some external module or loadable module.
- When we do **make module**, the modules will be generated in local location(where we are executing the make module). We need to put it inside the `/lib/module/'kernel_version'/` , in case we want to upgrade our kernel.
- To do the second part, we execute `make modules_install`
- Before loading kernel, grub boot loader will load and execute. We have to tell this bootloader that I have a new kernel. Can you please load OUR NEW KERNEL??

## >> Different between lsmod and modprobe 
- Even though we are trying to load Custom module from our Custom Kernel (4.4.72)
