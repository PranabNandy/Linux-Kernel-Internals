## module_platform_driver(xyz_ufs_driver);

UFS device is platform device so we need to write the platform driver for it.
Platform device is directly integrated into SoC as opposed to devices on external buses (like PCI or USB)

These devices don't usually require dynamic bus enumeration (like PCI or USB), and they are often described through platform-specific mechanisms such as Device Tree or ACPI.
These drivers are usually described in the device tree or **automatically probes** when the platform device is initialized.

### Macro Explanation: module_platform_driver()
The `module_platform_driver()` macro is a convenient way to register and unregister a platform driver in the Linux kernel. 
Without this macro, you would need to manually call functions like `platform_driver_register()` and `platform_driver_unregister()` in the module initialization and exit functions.

### Understanding exynos_ufs_driver

In the example, exynos_ufs_driver is the platform driver structure specific to the Exynos Universal Flash Storage (UFS) driver. This structure is defined elsewhere in the code and includes the driverâ€™s:

- **Probe function**: Initializes the UFS device when detected.
- `Remove function`: Cleans up resources when the device is no longer in use or the driver is unloaded.
- **`Driver name and ID table`**: Provides the name of the driver and matches it with the devices described in the device tree or ACPI tables.
