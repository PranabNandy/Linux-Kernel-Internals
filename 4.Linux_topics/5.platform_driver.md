## module_platform_driver(xyz_ufs_driver);

UFS device is platform device so we need to write the platform driver for it.
Platform device is directly integrated into SoC as opposed to devices on external buses (like PCI or USB)

These devices don't usually require dynamic bus enumeration (like PCI or USB), and they are often described through platform-specific mechanisms such as Device Tree or ACPI.
These drivers are usually described in the device tree or **automatically probes** when the platform device is initialized.

### Macro Explanation: module_platform_driver()
The `module_platform_driver()` macro is a convenient way to register and unregister a platform driver in the Linux kernel. 
Without this macro, you would need to manually call functions like `platform_driver_register()` and `platform_driver_unregister()` in the module initialization and exit functions.

### Understanding exynos_ufs_driver

In the example, exynos_ufs_driver is the platform driver structure specific to the Exynos Universal Flash Storage (UFS) driver. This structure is defined elsewhere in the code and includes the driverâ€™s:

- **Probe function**: Initializes the UFS device when detected.
- `Remove function`: Cleans up resources when the device is no longer in use or the driver is unloaded.
- **`Driver name and ID table`**: Provides the name of the driver and matches it with the devices described in the device tree or ACPI tables.

When the kernel module is loaded, module_platform_driver() expands to:
```c++
static int __init exynos_ufs_driver_init(void) {
    return platform_driver_register(&exynos_ufs_driver);
}

static void __exit exynos_ufs_driver_exit(void) {
    platform_driver_unregister(&exynos_ufs_driver);
}

module_init(exynos_ufs_driver_init);
module_exit(exynos_ufs_driver_exit);
```

### device_get_match_data(dev)
In the Linux kernel, the function device_get_match_data(dev) is used in device drivers to retrieve device-specific data that was matched during the device binding process. 

This data is usually specified through mechanisms like Device Tree (DT), ACPI, or static tables like `of_device_id` or `acpi_device_id`, which the driver uses to match the device. The retrieved data typically contains configuration information or platform-specific settings that the driver needs for initialization.

`const void *device_get_match_data(const struct device *dev);`
- dev: A pointer to the struct device representing the device in question.
- Return value: It returns a pointer to the matching data (usually a structure) if a match is found, or NULL if no match is found.


### Example of Device Matching in a Driver
```c++
static const struct of_device_id my_of_match[] = {
    { .compatible = "vendor,my-device", .data = &my_device_data },
    { /* sentinel */ }
};

static int my_driver_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
    const struct my_data *data;

    /* Get the match data for the device */
    data = device_get_match_data(&pdev->dev);
    if (!data) {
        dev_err(&pdev->dev, "No match data found\n");
        return -ENODEV;
    }

    /* Now use 'data' to initialize the device */
    initialize_my_device(data);

    return 0;
}


```


The driver might have an of_match_table as follows:
```c++
static const struct of_device_id my_of_match[] = {
    { .compatible = "vendor,my-device", .data = &my_device_config },
    { /* sentinel */ }
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, my_of_match);
```
