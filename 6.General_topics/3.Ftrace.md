# Ftrace

trace is built around smart lockless ring buffer implementation.

nabled in most distros by default

Activated by Kernel Hacking -> Tracers

Minimum kernel configuration required for ftraces
-------------------------------------------------
- CONFIG_FTRACE --> "Tracers"
- CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER --> Kernel Function Tracer
- CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER --> Kernel Function Graph Tracer
- CONFIG_STACK_TRACER	--> Traces Max stack

How to check whether ftrace is already enabled or not?
------------------------------------------------------

Most of the Linux distributions already provide ftrace, to check verify "tracing" directory exists or not.
```c++
# cat /boot/config-'uname-r' | grep CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER

# ls /sys/kernel/tracing
```
mount the tracefs by any of the two steps:

1. Adding an entry into /etc/fstab:
```C++
 tracefs       /sys/kernel/tracing       tracefs defaults        0       0
```
2. Using the mount command:
```C++
# umount /sys/kernel/tracing   
#mount -t tracefs nodev /sys/kernel/tracing
```
After mounting tracefs, you will have access to the control and output files of ftrace.

It was initially in debugfs(`/sys/kernel/debug/tracing`)

available_tracers
=================

Lists which tracers are configured

Important ones are:

	nop	 	-	No Action (No Tracer Enabled)
	function 	-	Trace Kernel Functions Entry
	function_graph	-	Trace Kernel Functions Entry and Exit  thus allowing to build a call graph
	blk		-	Block Tracer/blktrace
	mmiotrace	-	Trace interactions between drivers and hardware

Default tracer is nop

current_tracer
===============

The tracing program presently running

------------------------------------------------------

How to enable a tracer?
------------------------
```bash
$ echo 'name of tracer' > current_tracer 

$ echo 'function' > current_tracer

$ echo 'function_graph' > current_tracer

$ echo 'nop' > current_tracer
```

## Function Graph Tracer
---------------------

Function Graph Tracer is built on top of Function Tracer.
It also records the return address. By this you will come to know when a function enters and function exits.

``` $ echo function_graph > current_tracer ```

Function_graph tracer
	tracks the entry of the function
	tracks the exit of the function
	Execution Time
	CPU on which it is running

Important Points
----------------
Start of the function is denoted with '{' and end of the function is denoted with '}'. 
Functions that do not call any other functions, simply end with ';', also called as leaf functions
Duration column reports the time spent in the corresponding function. These numbers are only for the leaf functions, and the '}' symbol.

- When the duration is greater than 10 microseconds, a '+' is shown in the DURATION column 
- When the duration is greater than 100 microseconds, a '-' is shown in DURATION column
- When the duration is greater than 1000 microseconds, a '#' is shown in DURATION column
- When the duration is greater than 10 milliseconds, a '*' is shown in DURATION column
- When the duration is greater than 100 milliseconds, a '@' is shown in DURATION column
- When the duration is greater than 1 seconds, a '$' is shown in DURATION column
```bash
# cat trace | grep -F '$'
# cat trace | grep '#'
# cat trace | grep '@'
```

## Function Filtering
---------------------

The ftrace printout can be big, and finding exactly what it is you're looking for can be extremely difficult.

We can use filters to simplify our search.

The printout will only display information about functions we're interested in.


## What functions are available for the filter?
-------------------------------------------
All the functions that can be traced are present in available_filter_functions

## Limit What Functions you trace
-------------------------------
If you want only enable few of the functions or disable few of the functions, then you can use the below files

- set_ftrace_filter	-	Only trace these functions
- set_ftrace_notrace	-	Do not trace these functions
- (notrace takes precedence over filter)
```bash
Just echo function names into the files
# echo function_name > set_ftrace_filter

Can add multiple (white space delimited)
# echo function1 function2 > set_ftrace_filter

Append with the bash concatenation ">>"
# echo function >> set_ftrace_filter

Clear with just writing nothing to it
# echo > set_ftrace_notrace	

Example:
-------------

# echo function > current_tracer
# echo do_page_fault > set_ftrace_filter
# echo > trace
# cat trace

# echo > set_ftrace_filter
# echo kfree > set_ftrace_notrace

# echo vfs_* > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
# echo schedule > set_ftrace_filter

set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace affect function_graph as well

# echo do_IRQ > set_ftrace_filter
# echo function_graph > current_tracer
# echo > trace
# cat trace
```
This shows you the interrupt times, interrupt latencies of all the interrupts that are happening in your system
