# Understanding Round-Robin Task Scheduling Without an RTOS on a Microcontroller
üöÄ This concept describes how task scheduling and context switching can be implemented without an RTOS on a bare-metal microcontroller using SysTick and PendSV interrupts.

## 1. Key Features Explained
Feature	Explanation

‚úÖ Round-robin scheduling	= Each task (LED-blinking in this case) gets a fair share of CPU time in a circular order.

‚úÖ SysTick for timing = 	A timer interrupt triggers at regular intervals to manage timekeeping.

‚úÖ PendSV for context switching =	Saves the state of the current task and restores the next task‚Äôs state.

‚úÖ Each task uses its own PSP (Process Stack Pointer)	Keeps each task's stack separate, similar to a traditional RTOS.

‚úÖ No RTOS required	The system achieves multitasking using only hardware interrupts.

### Step 1: SysTick Timer Triggers Periodic Interrupts
- `This is the heartbeat of many Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). `‚Å£
- SysTick is a system timer in ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
- It generates an interrupt at fixed intervals (e.g., every 1ms).
- This interrupt is used to increment a system tick counter and request a context switch.
### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: PendSV Handles Context Switching
- PendSV (Pendable Service Call Interrupt) is a low-priority interrupt designed for context switching.
- It executes when the SysTick handler signals the need to switch tasks.
- Saves the current task's CPU registers and restores the next task's registers.
### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Each Task Has Its Own Stack (PSP)
- Each task runs in Thread Mode with a separate Process Stack Pointer (PSP).
- The Main Stack Pointer (MSP) is reserved for exception handling.
### Step 4: Round-Robin Task Execution
- SysTick fires ‚Üí Requests context switch via PendSV.
- PendSV saves the current task‚Äôs state (CPU registers, stack pointer).
- Next task‚Äôs state is restored from its PSP.
- Execution resumes from the new task.
- This cycle repeats, ensuring each task runs for a fixed time slice before switching.
