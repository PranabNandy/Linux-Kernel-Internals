# Understanding Round-Robin Task Scheduling Without an RTOS on a Microcontroller
This concept describes how task scheduling and context switching can be implemented without an RTOS on a bare-metal microcontroller using SysTick and PendSV interrupts.

## 1. Key Features Explained
Feature	Explanation

- Round-robin scheduling	= Each task (LED-blinking in this case) gets a fair share of CPU time in a circular order.
- SysTick for timing = 	A timer interrupt triggers at regular intervals to manage timekeeping.
- PendSV for context switching =	Saves the state of the current task and restores the next task’s state.
- Each task uses its own PSP (Process Stack Pointer)	Keeps each task's stack separate, similar to a traditional RTOS.
- No RTOS required	The system achieves multitasking using only hardware interrupts.
## 2. How It Works on a Microcontroller
### Step 1: SysTick Timer Triggers Periodic Interrupts
- SysTick is a system timer in ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
- It generates an interrupt at fixed intervals (e.g., every 1ms).
- This interrupt is used to increment a system tick counter and request a context switch.
### Step 2: PendSV Handles Context Switching
- PendSV (Pendable Service Call Interrupt) is a low-priority interrupt designed for context switching.
- It executes when the SysTick handler signals the need to switch tasks.
- Saves the current task's CPU registers and restores the next task's registers.
### Step 3: Each Task Has Its Own Stack (PSP)
- Each task runs in Thread Mode with a separate Process Stack Pointer (PSP).
- The Main Stack Pointer (MSP) is reserved for exception handling.
### Step 4: Round-Robin Task Execution
- SysTick fires → Requests context switch via PendSV.
- PendSV saves the current task’s state (CPU registers, stack pointer).
- Next task’s state is restored from its PSP.
- Execution resumes from the new task.
- This cycle repeats, ensuring each task runs for a fixed time slice before switching.
