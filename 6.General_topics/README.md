## What is ABI?
- Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a set of rules and conventions that define how software components (communicates effectively) interact with each other at the machine code level.
- Operating systems play a crucial role in defining and enforcing ABIs. 
The ABI for a particular operating system, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux, determines how software components interact with that system. 
This ensures that applications can run consistently across different hardware platforms.

### A Real-World Example:
Let's imagine you're building a Lego castle. The bricks are like software components, and the instructions are like the ABI. 
If you follow the instructions correctly, you can build a sturdy and stable castle. 
If you don't, the castle might collapse. Similarly, if software components don't adhere to the ABI, they might not work together as expected.
