- Without UFS, you can keep rootfs in any storage device like eMMC
- Without storage also, we can keep rootfs in DDR
-  The order of *.ko file execution is mentioned in Module file
    â†’Just for further clarity, we will mention the "depends on" in config file while building, accordingly module file will pick up the order

### Dynamically Loadable Module (SD card Driver):
1. Initially driver is not loaded to kernel
2. We inserted a device
3. Host controller of SD Card (H/W) sends a **hotplug event** to Kernel
4. Kernel first finds the appropiate driver ( sd card driver)
5. It will load it from rootfs
6. Driver will register itself in kernel driver framework
7. Then it will bound itself with the device
   
```cpp
# ls
bin dev etc opt sbin tmp var
boot dump lib proc sys usr
#
# pwd
/
#
# ls
bin etc proc sys usr
dev lib sbin tmp
# 
```
### Why some files/directories are still present after killing the UFS driver?
Because they are not loaded from UFS. In QNX:

The initial filesystem (called IFS or InitFS) is loaded directly into RAM at boot.

It contains a minimal OS image: essential binaries `(/bin, /sbin)`, libraries `(/lib)`, startup scripts, and directories like /dev, /proc, /sys, etc.
